  onUploadComplete={(keepOpen) => {
    // Handle completion
    console.log('Upload complete, keep modal open:', keepOpen);
  }}
  maxFileSize={50}
  allowedFileTypes={['.pdf', '.jpg', '.png', '.docx']}
/>
```

### Using Enhanced Context
```tsx
import { useUploadModal } from './context/UploadModalContext';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    isOpen, 
    openModal, 
    closeModal, 
    uploadStatus, 
    uploadStats 
  } = useUploadModal();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={openModal}>Upload Files</button>
      <p>Status: {uploadStatus}</p>
      <p>Progress: {uploadStats.completedFiles}/{uploadStats.totalFiles}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### Memory Management
```tsx
import useMemoryManagement from './hooks/useMemoryManagement';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { 
    registerFile, 
    memoryStats, 
    isMemoryHigh,
    formatMemorySize 
  } = useMemoryManagement({
    maxMemoryMB: 300,
    warningThresholdMB: 200
  });
  
  const handleFileSelect = (file: File) => {
    const id = registerFile(file);
    // File is now managed automatically
  };
};
```
