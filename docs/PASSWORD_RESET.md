# Password Reset Functionality

## Overview

The password reset functionality in DocVault allows users to reset their passwords through Firebase Authentication's email-based password reset system. When a user requests a password reset, Firebase sends an email with a secure link that allows them to create a new password.

## Implementation Details

### Components

- **ForgotPassword.tsx**: The UI component that handles the password reset request form.
- **AuthContext.tsx**: Contains the `resetPassword` function that interfaces with Firebase.

### Flow

1. User navigates to the Forgot Password page
2. User enters their email address
3. Client-side validation checks the email format
4. Request is sent to Firebase via `sendPasswordResetEmail`
5. User receives feedback (success or error message)
6. User receives an email with a reset link (if account exists)
7. User follows the link to create a new password

### Features

- Client-side email validation
- Specific error messages based on Firebase error codes
- Accessibility improvements (focus management, ARIA attributes)
- Responsive UI consistent with the application's design
- Clear success and error messaging

### Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:

- Invalid email format
- User not found
- Too many requests
- General errors

### Security Considerations

- Password reset links are time-limited
- Reset links are single-use
- Firebase handles the secure token generation and validation
- No sensitive information is exposed in client code

## Testing

To test the password reset functionality:

1. Navigate to `/forgot-password`
2. Enter a valid email address associated with an account
3. Submit the form
4. Verify you receive a success message
5. Check the email inbox for the reset link
6. Follow the link to reset your password
7. Verify you can log in with the new password

## Future Improvements

- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement rate limiting for password reset requests
- Add multi-factor authentication options
- Improve email templates for password reset
